# Sudoku-Game

As part of this project I am developing a 9x9 sudoku game called "Graphic Sudoku Game". This game allows Sudoku fans to solve puzzles at various difficulty levels - easy, medium and hard and use the help button if there is difficulty solving the game board. The help will be done using the Backtracking algorithm.

When registering for a game the player creates a user. In this procedure the player selects a specific nickname and under this nickname the results and times of each game board will be saved on the server.

The players can add their friends to the "My Friends" list by clicking the "Add Friends" button. If the other player has approved the companies, the two players will be able to compete between them -The fastest player is the winner. In addition, the two players will be able to play on a common board for collaboration in Sudoku's solution.

A two-player sudoku game will contain a chat so the two players will talk to each other and share ideas for solving the board.
My role as application developer is to implement a client side that is convenient, easy and simple and implement server side that requires access to each user's database.
