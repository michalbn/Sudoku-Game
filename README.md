# Sudoku-Game

For my project I have decided to develop a 9x9 Sudoku game.  "Graphic Sudoku Game".
My game allows Sudoku fans to solve puzzles at various difficulty levels - easy, medium and hard. If they struggle solving the game board; they will be able to utilize the help button.

When a player registers for a game, a user is created. During this process the player selects a name. The results and times of each game board will be saved on the server under the selected name.

The players can add their friends to the "My Friends" list by clicking the "Add Friends" button. Once the player approves the request, they will be able to compete against each other. The one who finishes the puzzle first is the winner. Furthermore, the two players will be able to play on a common board and cooperate in solving the puzzle.

In addition, a two-player Sudoku game will contain a chat which will enable the players to talk and share their ideas on how to solve the board.

My role as application developer, is to create a convenient, easy and simple environment for the client and implement a server that requires access to each user's database.
